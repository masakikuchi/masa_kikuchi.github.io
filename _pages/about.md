Welcome! I am a PhD student in the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.wustl.edu/) at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/). I was previously a Research Fellow for [Japan Society for the Promotion of Science](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-pd/index.html).

I use computational and experimental methods to study how past conflicts shape beliefs and perceptions in international relations. My research focuses on how wartime victimization, exposure to violence, and war outcomes influence support for aggressive security policies and perceptions of perpetratorsâ€™ culture. I also have broad interests in public attitudes toward foreign policy, post-conflict state-building, and the links between music and politics. My articles have been published or are forthcoming in peer-reviewed journals, including *Journal of Peace Research* and *BMC Public Health*.

I received my BA (2019) and MA (2021) in Political Science from [Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/), Japan. Outside of academic work, I enjoy playing the violin and cheering for Cardinals.
