Welcome! I am a PhD student in the [Department of Political Science](https://polisci.wustl.edu/) at [Washington University in St. Louis](https://wustl.edu/). I was previously a Research Fellow for [Japan Society for the Promotion of Science](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-pd/index.html).

I study international relations, exploring the links between international politics and identities of individuals and states. My articles are published or forthcoming in peer-reviewed journals, including *Journal of Peace Research* and *BMC Public Health*. You can download my latest CV [here](https://wustl.box.com/s/539011sicc6be42sv919p1g2lrdt143e).

I received my BA (2019) and MA (2021) in Political Science from [Waseda University](https://www.waseda.jp/top/en/), Japan. Outside of work, I play the violin and root for Dodgers.
